Afiora Care 🌍♿
AI-Driven Healthcare Accessibility & Policy Impact Assessment Platform for Persons with Disabilities (PwD)
Policy Context & Need

Public healthcare policies such as hospital licensing norms, accessibility regulations, and healthcare benefit schemes are intended to protect vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities (PwD).

However, evaluating how effectively these policies translate into real-world accessibility and service availability remains challenging due to:

Fragmented demographic and economic data

Limited visibility into physical accessibility infrastructure

Insufficient on-ground feedback mechanisms

Lack of integrated geographic insights

As a result, both PwD users and institutional stakeholders face uncertainty in understanding whether accessibility policies are being implemented as intended.

Problem Statement

Automatically assessing the impact of healthcare-related public policies on vulnerable populations requires integrating and reasoning over diverse datasets, including:

Demographic characteristics

Infrastructure readiness and accessibility compliance

Geographic accessibility and service coverage

Availability of human support systems

At the same time, policy gaps and implementation risks must be identified early to prevent exclusion, delayed care, and unequal access for persons with disabilities.

Solution Overview — Afiora Care

Afiora Care is an agentic AI-based healthcare accessibility and policy impact assessment platform designed to support persons with disabilities while enabling institutions to evaluate policy effectiveness.

The platform integrates:

Artificial intelligence for policy interpretation and reasoning

Geospatial accessibility mapping to visualize infrastructure and service gaps

A verified human support network to reduce real-world access risks

Together, these components convert healthcare and accessibility policies into measurable, real-world outcomes.

Core Capabilities

Identification of nearby healthcare facilities with accessibility features aligned to regulatory and policy guidelines

AI-assisted simplification of medical reports, healthcare policies, and government schemes into accessible language

Policy-aware eligibility guidance for healthcare rights, insurance, and public benefit programs

Accessibility scoring of hospitals to assess readiness, compliance, and exposure to access risks

Geospatial visualization of accessibility infrastructure, service gaps, and reported physical barriers

Connection to trained volunteers to mitigate access risks and provide real-world assistance

AI-generated accessibility recommendations for hospitals, NGOs, and policymakers

Risk Assessment & Policy Feedback

Afiora Care identifies implementation risks such as:

Inaccessible infrastructure

Lack of support services

Uneven geographic distribution of accessible healthcare

Aggregated insights enable hospitals, NGOs, and policymakers to:

Identify high-risk regions

Prioritize corrective actions

Improve compliance with accessibility and healthcare policies

This creates a continuous feedback loop between policy intent and real-world outcomes.

Technology Approach

Afiora Care is developed using modern AI and geospatial technologies with a focus on:

Explainability

Accessibility

Privacy

Ethical use

Artificial intelligence supports data integration and reasoning, while trained volunteers provide trusted, real-world assistance to complement digital intelligence.
